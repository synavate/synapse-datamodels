# Data Model Planning and Collaboration
Version @ 7 Feb 2024 - 0.0.1 - Testing.

Please version as you evolve the data model and the requirements based on use cases expand.

- Each data model and schema maintained by Synavate and our community is dependent on the use case of the service.


## Foundational Schemas
- Our primary user identifier. With privacy as a cornerstone of the Synapse application we are committed to keeping private information private.
- In our collaboration with our Vault partners (TBC by v0.0.5) we will maintain a public list of what is contained in our user schema.


## Adding a schema for your use case:
- If you are developing a use case that is not already specified by the schemas listed please feel free to open a pull request with your suggested schema.
- Our team's understanding of the needs of both our users, and the Synapse product itself with evolve with time.
- We will maintain former versions and ask that semantic versioning is used when changes are made to the schema. Particularly where breaking changes are concerned.
